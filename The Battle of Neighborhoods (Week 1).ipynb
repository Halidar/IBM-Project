    "Even thou electric cars are currently on the rise, most of us still rely on the conventional combustion engine powered vehicles. Average American uses 656 gallons of fuel per person, per year, and while there is a lot of talk about the whole industry - mining, refining etc. most of us usual deal only with the Gas Stations themselves, as both the point of purchase and the everyday representative of the entire industry. \n",
    "  \n",
    "For this assignment we will take a look at a scenario of a new gas station chain (like Shell,  BP, etc.) planning to expand their business in New York City. We will focus on an existing venues and try to determine a weak spots, as a possible future purchases. Our potential client is interested in a underperforming and ineffective places, which can be bought and transformed in a new ones under the new logo, as well as a places that lacks an access to a gas stations. \n"

    "\n",
    "Based on the results we can see that the worst performing stations are located Cypress Hills and Broadway Junction in Brooklyn, Far Rockaway, Springfield Gardens and Brookville in Queens and Egbertville in Staten Island. Their overall satisfaction is below 5.9 which is even below the average for the entire city making them and interesting picks for our enterprise. However it's also important to notice that Broadway Junction and Cypress Hills, as well as Springfield Gardens and Brookville are located very close to each other making it reasonable to choose only one of each in Brooklyn and Queens."

    "   \n",
    "Our report clearly shows that there are at least two points where we should focus on a potential gas station acquisition. Springfield Gardens or Brookville station in Queens as there are located very close to each other and Broadway Junction or Cypress Hills at Queens. All of these stations not only fall way below average rating for gas stations in New York, but also are the lowest scores in the entire city. This is a strong signal that these stations are underperfoming and there is potentially a rooms for improvement here. "
